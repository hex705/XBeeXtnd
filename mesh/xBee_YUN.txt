the small shield vs debug:

the shiled with xBee connects radio to arduino:

so we must cross the wires --  Rx-Tx (or Ard - Rx to xBee-Dout)

on a ftdi board, softserial Tx goes to Tx on board -- it is pass through becasue translation happens on other side(?).



notes on xBee and a YUN 

see:
http://blog.danielkerris.com/?p=364


altserial works with a serial converter


yun 5 --> USB-serial Tx
yun 13 -> USB-serial Rx


no flow control pins 


now 

try to connect this to a radio at 38400 

series 1 radios -- can send a value from arduino t oother radio via shield and alt

jumpers:

DIN = 5
DOUT  =13


for some unknown reason this now wants to work so lets try some more stuff 


have to slow the system down a great deal -- at 9600 baud it works with the altsoftware serial librariy from (version 1.2) :

https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_AltSoftSerial.html


it seems to work well including reset of NI, ND and of basic message reception --  did not send messages over air but since commands work it seems likely that we are OK


sendfile:
from an UNO:
xBee radio at 9600 on shield on pins 0,1

serial debug on pins 8,9 with softserial

button on pin 4

target radio address set to match target radio (64 bit)

on an uno:

files for test (remote radio pointing to the xBee on Yun) with a button for creating ND message request.



to receive this on an UNO --  LCD on unsual PINS  FTDI--> serial on 8/9 with softSerial. xBee shield xBee radio with target address.

~/Documents/Project Code/XBeeExtended/Mesh/XbXt_test_lcdWorks_passXbee

to receive on YUN :

LCD with pin 5 changes to pin 6 PINS  so instantiate with: 
LiquidCrystal  lcd(12,11,6,4,3,2);

Console and bridge for debug.

xBee radio and alt serial at 9600 for serial
xBee shield xBee radio with target address -- Din --> 5,  Dout --> 13
altsoftserial for comm with radio

IOT book with some basic stuff going on --

loggin to a google doc is done -- need to test embed it in a page 


anlso we have a twitter feed runnig

twitter eats space tho
